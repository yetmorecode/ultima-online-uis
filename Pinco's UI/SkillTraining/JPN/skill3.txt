Activate the skill via macro or skill button and target a creature. You can gain from repeating upon the same creature.

Animal Lore can also be raised by using the Animal Taming and Veterinary skills. 

Using veterinary on a tamed pet and getting a passive gain is the preferred method of training. Once you get one passive gain, lock Veterinary and keep vetting your pet for endless gains.
