
Focus is the easiest skill to train, even if you don't want to. Every time you regenerate 1 Mana or Stamina you have a chance to gain in Focus. Simply do activities which cause you to lose mana and stamina. Using up mana can be accomplished by casting any type of spell. To lower stamina you can just run around a lot or to be overweight. Doing both at the same time will quicken gains.
