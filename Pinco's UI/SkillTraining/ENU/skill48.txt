
0 - 30: Train at NPC Thief

30 - 120: You will need a pack animal (Pack Horse, Pack Llama, or Giant Beetle) and a stack of gold (at least 12 stones). Make sure you tell the pack animal to guard you if you train inside the guard zone!
Now open the pack of the pack animal and then put the gold stack inside. Now use the stealing skill on it and when you successfully steal the item, put it back on the pack animal.
