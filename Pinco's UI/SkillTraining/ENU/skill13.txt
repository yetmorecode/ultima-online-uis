
0 - 30: Train from an NPC Paladin in Luna

30 - 45: Hold a weapon in hand and cast Consecrate Weapon

45 - 60: Cast Divine Fury

60 - 70: Cast Enemy of One

70 - 90: Cast Holy Light

90 - 115: Cast Noble Sacrifice

The only method to gain after 115 is through the Guaranteed Gain System (GGS) or the Satyr Trick or by using scrolls of transcendence, as it is impossible to forcefully train any further due to the fact that every Chivalry spell has a 100% success chance at 115 skill and higher.
