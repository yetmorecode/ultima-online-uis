
Spirit Speak will raise when Necromancy spells are cast. If you are training a Necromancer it is best to let Spirit Speak raise passively until you finish training. Once Necromancy is at the level you want, the quickest way to raise Spirit Speak is: 

1. Turn into Lich Form if able. 

2. Summon a Shadow Wisp if able. 

3. Wear 40% Lower Mana Cost, 2 Faster Casting, and 6 Faster Cast Recovery. 

4. Wear as much Mana Regeneration as possible. 

5. Equip a weapon. 

6. Cast Curse Weapon over and over.
